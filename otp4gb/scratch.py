    # Could just use NoHAM - 2,700 or NoRMS zoning systems

    # In other words, have larger radius's for less dense areas

    # alternatively, if not radius, for every LSOA we only want to consider getting to the nearest 10.
    # Probably just add a check to increase if you dont have many other zones returned

    # if radius filter reutns more than ten - leave at this,
    # if not, increase radious until you have at least 10 other LSOAs returned
